# thermo_toolkit
This toolkit is designed to calculate thermodynamic corrections to VASP structural minimization simulations and is particular to zeolites as well as specific frameworks. The mathematics are based on Gaussian [https://gaussian.com/vib/] and the thermodynamics follows Cramer's "Essentials of Computational Chemistry: Theories and Models".
